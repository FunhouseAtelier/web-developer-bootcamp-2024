/* Jason's NOTE: Much of the CSS code below comes from the CSS reset webpage Colt used in the lesson. It is fine to just copy and paste this into your code. CSS resets are usually not typed out manually, they are copied or imported (you'll learn all about that later) from somewhere, because they are really tedius to type out. Just look at how many elements are selected with just the first set of CSS rules. There's 80 different elements! You don't need to learn what all of these elements are, and there are many you will probably never use. */
